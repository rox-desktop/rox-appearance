Theme

Theme lets you choose toolkit (GTK+) themes and icon themes (XDG).
OroboROX window-manager theme support is planned.
Maybe Qt/KDE themes will be supported in the future as well.


New versions can be found here:

You need to be running a recent (later than 0.1.21) version of ROX-Session,
otherwise it won't work.
