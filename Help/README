			Appearance
			Choose themes and other configuration items
			by Guido Schimmels and Tony Houghton

Brief
~~~~~

Appearance

Appearance lets you choose toolkit (GTK+) themes and colour scheme,
icon themes (XDG) and some toolbar and meu options.

New versions can be found here:

	http://rox.sourceforge.net/desktop/Appearance

You need to be running a recent (later than 0.1.21) version of ROX-Session,
otherwise it won't work at all, while the colour scheme options require the
C version of ROX-Session (0.40.0 or later).
